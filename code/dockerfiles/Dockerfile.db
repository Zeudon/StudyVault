## Dockerfile for the PostgreSQL database service
#
# You can normally use the official postgres:16 image directly in
# docker-compose.  This Dockerfile wraps the official image and allows
# you to include optional initialization scripts.  The underlying
# postgres image will automatically run any scripts placed in
# /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d during container startup.

FROM postgres:16

# Copy initialization scripts (SQL or shell files) into the entrypoint directory
# If you have any .sql or .sh files that set up your schema or seed data,
# place them in the init-scripts directory in your repository and uncomment
# the COPY line below.  See the Docker and Postgres docs for details on
# how init scripts are executed【730129979721829†L151-L174】.
